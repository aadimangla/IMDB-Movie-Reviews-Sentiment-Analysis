<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](images/product.png)

Customer service bot is a bot that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to answer basic customer questions via a business messenger. It can recognize and answer multiple forms of the same question and can be trained to give instant responses using your preferred voice or text.

Here's why:
* AI chatbots use your existing information and resources, like FAQs or knowledge base articles, to help answer and resolve your customers’ questions. 
* They can recognize and answer multiple forms of the same question and can be trained to give instant responses using your preferred voice and tone.
* Chatbots offers instant resolutions
*Your business can offer 24/7 conversational support
*Chatbots continuously learn
* You can tailor answers to different types of customers 
* Your team has more context on each customer
* A consistent user experience is created

Chatbots and AI received a major facelift in recent years. The once futuristic-yet-a-pain-in-the-butt digital assistants are being fueled with more data to better serve customers and drive sales.

Is it worth the time and money investment? It depends on your industry and company needs. But today’s sophisticated bot infrastructures have a lot to offer that most businesses can benefit from.
